# ValkyrieLoL

League of Legends python scripting platform. You have to install boost libraries manually in the folder ProjectValkyrie\ValkyrieDLL\boost. It is not preinstalled in order to keep the size of the repository small. 

Project compiles only on Release x86, that is because league is built on x86 and you cannot attach a debugger to LoL so it didnt make sense to configure a Debug or x64 build.

This project contains only the Core DLL and the Client for the platform, https://github.com/ValkyrieGroup/ValkyrieLoLDeployable this repository contains the necessary data for the DLL to work and also some python scripts. The reason it is separated is because this repository was/is not public.
